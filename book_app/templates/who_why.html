					Hey there, I  am Naveen Chahar. I believe the saying <span class='text-primary'>"books are the best friends of human." </span>
					<br><br>
					I am a Computer Science & Engineering student. I started reading books almost two years ago. Probably reading is the one of best decision I have ever taken. It satisfy my hunger for gathering knowledge from the greats. I have read 30+ book till now on success, sales, network marketing,
					stress management, communication and many more. Now I have decided to share short summeries with all.
					<br><br>
					Reading on continious basis is more powerful than reading oscassionally.
					<br><br>
					<span class='h4 text-dark'>So, here my plan</span> 
					<br><br>
					 I will read minimum 2 books every month and post summary in most effective way so that you can get the best from it. Surely, summaries are not the replacement of reading whole book,
					 instead summery provides the inside of book and it reflects what a book is all about.
					 <br><br>
					 I strongly recommend if you found any book summary really interesting and related then just read the whole book. In that way you will be benefited most.
					 <br><br>
					 Happy Reading!
